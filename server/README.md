# Overview
The server provides an HTTP API and a web dashboard. 

Both let you manage battery monitor data. 

# Web UI
The Web UI provides a nice dashboard on top of the HTTP API. Hosted by the same 
server which provides the HTTP API.

All functions available in the API can be accessed via the dashboard.  

# HTTP API
The HTTP API is the primary interface for managing data in the battery monitor 
platform.  

The server itself is written in Golang.
